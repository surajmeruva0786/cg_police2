    "This notebook implements a simple autonomous AI agent that monitors news sources for cybercrime-related incidents. The agent automatically fetches newspaper articles, identifies fraud and cybercrime mentions, summarizes key information, and generates a daily intelligence brief for law enforcement agencies. This is a **Stage-1 prototype** focused on clarity and simplicity—designed to evolve into a production-ready system."

    "## What is an AI Agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of an AI agent as a **smart assistant that can act on its own**. Unlike a simple chatbot that just answers questions, an agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Perceives** its environment (reads news, checks data)\n",
    "2. **Thinks** about what it sees (analyzes, filters, decides)\n",
    "3. **Acts** on its analysis (summarizes, reports, alerts)\n",
    "4. **Repeats** this cycle autonomously\n",
    "\n",
    "In Ed Donner's framework, an agent has:\n",
    "- **Goals** (find cybercrime news)\n",
    "- **Tools** (web scraping, LLM reasoning)\n",
    "- **Memory** (what it has already processed)\n",
    "- **Actions** (generate reports)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our agent is simple but powerful: it replaces hours of manual news monitoring with an automated, intelligent system."

    "\n",
    "This Stage-1 prototype demonstrates the core agent pattern. Here's how we can evolve it:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Immediate Next Steps (Stage-2)**\n",
    "- **Automation**: Schedule the agent to run every 6 hours using cron jobs or cloud functions\n",
    "- **Real RSS Feeds**: Connect to actual news sources (Times of India, The Hindu, etc.)\n",
    "- **Better Classification**: Replace keyword matching with LLM-based relevance scoring\n",
    "- **Sentiment Analysis**: Track public sentiment around cybercrime incidents\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Medium-Term (Stage-3)**\n",
    "- **Admin Dashboard**: Build a web interface for viewing reports and managing alerts\n",
    "- **Alert System**: Send notifications for high-priority incidents (email, SMS, Slack)\n",
    "- **Trend Detection**: Track recurring patterns and emerging threats over time\n",
    "- **Multi-Source Integration**: Add social media monitoring (Twitter, Reddit)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advanced (Stage-4 - Multi-Agent System)**\n",
    "- **Specialist Agents**: Deploy separate agents for different cybercrime types\n",
    "  - Agent 1: Financial fraud (UPI, cryptocurrency)\n",
    "  - Agent 2: Social engineering (phishing, deepfakes)\n",
    "  - Agent 3: Infrastructure attacks (ransomware, DDoS)\n",
    "- **Coordinator Agent**: Synthesizes findings from all specialist agents\n",
    "- **Vector Database**: Store and search historical intelligence reports\n",
    "- **Predictive Analytics**: Use ML to forecast cybercrime trends\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Production Deployment**\n",
    "- **API Integration**: Connect with government databases and case management systems\n",
    "- **Compliance**: Ensure data privacy and security standards (encryption, access logs)\n",
    "- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Allow analysts to provide feedback and refine agent behavior\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Deploy on cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP) for 24/7 operation\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
