Mob loots police armoury in
Manipur; policeman killed

The Hindu Bureau
NEW DELHI

A police armoury was loot-
ed and a Manipur Rifles
policeman was killed in
Manipur on Thursday, a
police official said. Anoth-
er attempt to loot weapons
in Imphal city was thwart-
ed by the police.

The incidents come a
day ahead of a Supreme
Court hearing on the mat-
ter.

The first incident took
place in Bishnupur district
when a mob looted auto-
matic weapons from the
second Indian Reserve Bat-
talion (IRB) at Naransena.
The number of weapons
looted from the armoury is
not known.

Curfew relaxations
in Imphal East and
Imphal West were
withdrawn and
restrictions Imposed

Many people had gath-
ered around 12 km away to
protest a tribal group’s call
for mass burial of 35 Kuki-
Zo people who were killed
in the ethnic violence that
erupted in the State on
May 3.

The protesters led by
women tried to storm the
way to the area where the
burial was planned but
were stopped by the Rapid
Action Force (RAF) and the
Army.

Though the burial had

been called off after the
Union Home Ministry in-
tervened and spoke to the
tribal leaders, the protes-
ters wanted to proceed to
the area. The said field is a
government notified land.

The second incident
took place at Kourtuk on
Imphal West-Kangpokpi
border where a policeman
attached to 6 Manipur Ri-
fles, identified as T. Rishi
(48), was shot in the head
by armed miscreants from
the hill areas.

Meanwhile, curfew re-
laxations in Imphal East
and Imphal West were
withdrawn and restrictions
imposed during the day as
a precautionary measure.
Relaxation has been given
only from 5 a.m. to noon.
